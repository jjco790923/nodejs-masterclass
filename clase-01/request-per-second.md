## Node.js Requests Per Second

A benchmark made by Fastify, shows that Express.js— a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework with a robust set of features for web and mobile— can handle approx 10,000 requests per second and the basic HTTP module, 70K requests per second. This is very fast.
